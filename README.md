## 🔩 How we built it 🎃👻

This application is build on JavaScript as a backend and I use HTML and CSS, cess for designing user interface.

## 💪🏻 Challenges we ran into 🎃👻

Here, I faced lots of challenges like syntax errors, JavaScript integration issues, and all the other issues, but after a long time of debugging and fixing I run & execute my code sample successfully. Also here I could not properly implement the API to frontend because of time constrictions and I tried to make use of each and every tool in a creative and unique way possible. This project has still lot of potential and improvements to make.

Second, thing is that add a payment gateway page where users can easily purchase all kinds of stuffs by cards. Finally I want to add more features and other Halloween products.
